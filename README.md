# Fullstack Todo App
Hi there! I am Vlad, and i am IT student in a collage. 
My way was started as a Frontend Developer. I was learned html, css, javascript and so many frameworks. I make my projects.
Today i am React & Python Developer. 
I was maked this Fullstack "Todo-App" using React & Django.
In this Todo-Application you can provide your tasks, and description. You can delete task, edit task or description and filter your tasks completed or incompleted.
You can see and evaluate my code, because it's my first fullstack project.
I am now actively looking for jobs in the IT technology field, and i will wait to your offer. ;)
Best wishes ladies and gentlemen.
